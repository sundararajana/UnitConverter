UnitConverter application for Android devices

This android application converts between units. For example, miles to 
kilometer, degrees to radians and so on. The list of conversions supported
are stored in a database table. The application comes with a set of 
pre-defined conversion formulae. But, user can add/modify more conversion
formulae.

How to build?

You need couple of jars to build and run this project.
 
* antlr-runtime-3.5.1.jar here. 

It is available for download @ 
   
    http://www.antlr3.org/download/antlr-runtime-3.5.1.jar

* android-support-v4.jar

from your android sdk in the directory 

    $android_sdk/extras/android/support/v4/

where $android_sdk is your android sdk installation directory.

You have to copy the above jars under "./libs" directory.

After copying, you can open this project in Eclipse with ADT plugin or
use command line ant build. To use command line build, run the following
command in this directory:

    android update project --path .


where 'android' command is from your android sdk installation. Above command
creates ant build script. You can build/install the app using

    ant debug
    ant debug install

About the sources:

Android Activities:

FormulaeListActivity 

   "main" screen. Shows list of formulae available. User can choose by
     selecting a specific list item and use the selected formula

    Menus: Add Formula - go to new formula addition activity
           Eval Expression - go to expression evaluator activity

    Context menu: (long press on a formula item)
           Edit Formula - edit the current formula
           Delete Formula - delete current formula after confirmation
           
FormulaUseActivity

    User enters input for a specific formula. Formula is evaluated and
    the result shown on screen.


AddModifyFormulaActivity

    Add or update existing conversion formula

ExprEvalActivity

   Formula evaluation test. User can enter arbitray expression and evaluate.
   Expression evaluation by an interpreter generated by an ANTLR grammar.
   See Expr.g

   Menu: Formula List - go to "main" activity

Expression language:

Expression language is implemented using ANTLR v3 grammar in Expr.g file.
Pre-generated ANTLR files are in "simpleexpr" package.

If you want to modify the expression language, update Expr.g and regenerate
ANTLR files using

   java -jar antlr-3.5.1-complete.jar Expr.g

and copy the generated files under ./src/simpleexpr package

NOTE: antlr-3.5.1-complete.jar can be downloaded from http://www.antlr3.org

Pre-defined formulae:

Pre-defined formulae are stored in "asserts/init_formulae" file (Simple
cvs file). You can add more built-in formulae by editing this file.
You need build and re-deploy the apk when you do so.

Formula store:

A sqlite3 database is used to store all formulae. Pre-defined formulae
is imported on database creation. User additions/modifications are reflected
in this database.

To check this database, use the following commands from adb shell:

   $ cd /data/data/in.sundar.activity/databases
   $ sqlite3 data
